Welcome! 
I’m happy you’re here. 

You can call me Eli, which is one of my nicknames, or Elizabet, which is my full first name. Either way, I’m a student of life and I started this blog in 2022 and named it after my beautiful degree/passion: Psychology. 

I've decided to write about Psychology because I find human nature very interesting and I love the fact that there are different focuses within Psychology which allow for a lot of variety and knowledge to be gained.
